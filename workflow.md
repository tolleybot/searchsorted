## Workflow for Using Custom Operators in ONNX Runtime with PyTorch

This guide outlines the steps for integrating a custom operator defined in PyTorch into an ONNX model and subsequently running that model with ONNX Runtime in Python, leveraging a custom C++ implementation for the operator.

### Step 1: Define a PyTorch C++ Custom Operator

1. **Implementation**: Define your custom operator in PyTorch using C++. This involves writing the forward and backward functions for your operator and registering it with a unique name, within a specific domain and namespace.

### Step 2: Export the Model to ONNX

2. **Exporting with Annotations**: Ensure that the custom operator is correctly annotated with its domain and namespace during the export from PyTorch to ONNX. You may need to provide a symbolic function for the custom operator to aid the exporter in translating it into the corresponding ONNX operator.

### Step 3: Create Another C++ Library for the Operator

3. **ONNX Runtime Implementation**: Implement the custom operator for ONNX Runtime by defining a class that inherits from `Ort::CustomOpBase` and overrides the `Compute` method, which contains the logic for executing the operator during inference.
4. **Compilation**: Compile this implementation into a shared library (`.so`, `.dll`, or `.dylib`, depending on your platform).

### Step 4: Use `load_custom_op_library` in Python

5. **Loading the Library**: Utilize the ONNX Runtime Extensions package in Python to load the compiled custom operator library before initializing the ONNX Runtime inference session. This allows ONNX Runtime to recognize and use your custom operator during inference.

### Step 5: Load Your ONNX Model

6. **Inference Session**: After registering the custom operator library, load your ONNX model using ONNX Runtime's `InferenceSession` in Python. The model can now utilize the custom operator, enabling inference execution.

### Practical Example

```python
import onnxruntime as ort
from onnxruntime_extensions import get_library_path

# Path to the compiled custom operator library
custom_op_library_path = get_library_path("my_custom_op_library")

# Create session options and register the custom operator library
so = ort.SessionOptions()
so.register_custom_ops_library(custom_op_library_path)

# Load the ONNX model that uses the custom operator
sess = ort.InferenceSession("path_to_my_model.onnx", sess_options=so)

# Run inference with the model
input_data = {...}  # Prepare your input data
outputs = sess.run(None, input_data)
